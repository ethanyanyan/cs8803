# Additional Features & Implementation Details

## 1. Architecture

- **SwiftUI** for the UI, using a multi-tab structure:

  - **FeedView**: displays shared photos (TODO)
  - **PostView**: allows photo uploads
  - **ProfileView**: user info, sign out
    - Profile Avatar can be uploaded using the Apple's Photos app.

- **Firebase**:
  - **Auth** for user sign in/out.
  - **Storage** for storing uploaded images (photos, avatars).
  - **Firestore** for storing user profiles, feed data, etc.

## 2. Profile Management

- Each user has a document (or node) named by their `uid` as generated by Firebase when creating a User account.
- Data includes `displayName`, `avatarURL`, `location`, etc.
- The app reads and writes user data in `ProfileView`.

- Profile Avatar Photo can be selected from user's Photos library. The photo is then uploaded and stored in Cloudinary,
  and the URL is stored in Firestore as well.

## 3. Location

- Planned: integrate Core Location for automatic location fetching & geocoding.
- Currently: manual text field input.

## 4. Friend System

- Users can view a friends list and add/delete friends.
- Planned: Users can only view photos of friends.

## 5. Future Enhancements

- **Social Logins**: Integrate Google / Facebook using pods.
- **Image Caching**: Efficiently cache images using SwiftUI or third-party libraries (e.g., SDWebImageSwiftUI).
- **Notifications**: For likes, comments, or new followers.
- **Access Control**: Fine-tune security rules in Firebase.

## 6. Learnings Thus Far

- **Steep Learning Curve**: I have no prior experience with developing in Swift or iOS. Therefore, the initial learning curve is very steep. Youtube channels such as @iOSAcademy as suggested by the CS8803-MAS Teaching Staff did help to ease this initial learning curve slightly.
- **Build Failure**: The very first build kept failing due to User Sandboxing issues, had to search stackoverflow.com to learn about this, turn it off, before successfully building the project.
- **Restrictive API**: Firebase does not provide Firestore in the free tier. Hence, I was unable to store images without upgrading to a pay-as-you-go tier. I opted to use Cloudinary instead, which has free storage of images in its free tier. Downsides of this include limited credits of the account with Cloudinary.
